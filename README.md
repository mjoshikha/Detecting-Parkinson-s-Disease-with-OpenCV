For the patients suffering from Parkinson's Disease, it has been observed that impairment in the handwriting is directly proportional to severity of the disease. Also, the speed and pressure applied to the pen while sketching or writing something are also much lower in patients suffering from Parkinson's disease. Therefore, correctly identifying such biomarkers accurately and precisely at the onset of the disease will lead to a better clinical diagnosis. Henceforth, in this project, a system design is proposed for analyzing Spiral drawing patterns and wave drawing patterns in patients suffering from Parkinson's disease and healthy subjects.
